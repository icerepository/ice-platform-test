1. Network Flow and Security: The architecture should prioritize robust network flow management and incorporate effective security measures to safeguard data and infrastructure.

2. Performance Response: The architecture should be designed to deliver efficient and responsive performance, ensuring quick response times and minimal latency.

3. Cost Optimization: The architecture should aim for cost optimization by implementing resource-efficient solutions and considering factors such as scalability and utilization of resources.

4. Monitoring: The architecture should include a comprehensive monitoring system that enables real-time tracking and analysis of the application's performance, identifying potential issues or bottlenecks.


*Note:*
